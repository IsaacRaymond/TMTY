Chapter 1 Homework




I live in a small town in rural Maine. I'm involved in the local community, I study programming on the side, and I'm raising two twin boys. I'm excited to work with you in this course!
I love my profession. I've been teaching mathematics for several years now. Although I've mastered the material you'll encounter this semester, I'll be putting myself back in your shoes and always reminding myself that I once did not speak the language of math and calculus. Hopefully I can address your questions in a very understandable way!
Please always feel free to reach out to me with any questions or concerns!
-Isaac

DISCUSSION BOARD ONE
Please pick one of the following to respond to:

1. Reading and Writing Numeric and Verbal Whole Numbers

Why do you feel it is important to understand how to read and write numeric and verbal whole numbers?

What does this type of math have to do with being a Funeral Director and Embalmer?


2. Rounding Whole Numbers

Many of the whole numbers you read and hear are rounded numbers. Government statistics are usually rounded numbers. The financial reports of companies also use rounded numbers. All rounded numbers are approximate numbers. The more rounding you do, the more you approximate the number.

Why would rounding be important you your future career?

Based on your reading, what is the easiest method to dissect and solve word problems?

Respond to at least two of your fellow classmates.


DISCUSSION BOARD TWO

1.  A funeral home services professional has to spend time doing different tasks.  What do you feel is the largest fraction of time spent by a funeral home services professional?  What about the other fractions of time?  For instance; maybe 1/4th of the time is paperwork/record keeping, 1/8th of the time is working with customers, etc.


2.  A mortician works 45 hours a week.  15 hours are spent doing paperwork.  Another mortician works 25 hours a week and spends 8 hours, 20 minutes on paperwork.  Which mortician spends the greater fraction of time working on paperwork?  Why?


Respond to at least two of your fellow classmates. 


DISCUSSION BOARD THREE
You have your choice of what to discuss. Below is two options. You can also choose a subject from this area that interests you.

1.  Most small businesses depend on a checking account for efficient record keeping.

With today's technology, is there really a need to utilize a checking account?

Respond to at least two of your fellow classmates.



DISCUSSION BOARD FOUR
You have your choice of what to discuss. Below is two options. You can also choose a subject from this area that interests you.



1.  What are some of the types of bank accounts available to businesses?  Which ones do you think would be best for a funeral home?



2.   Checking accounts are convenient.  We can electronically deposit money, we don't have to manage physical monies ourselves, etc.  Other than convenience, why is it important for a business to have a separate business account?



Respond to at least two of your fellow classmates.




DISCUSSION BOARD FIVE
You have your choice of what to discuss. Below are two options. You can also choose a subject from this area that interests you.

1.  Have you ever used algebra to solve a real world problem?  If so, describe the event and how algebra helped you find a solution.


2. Invent a word problem that is related to the funeral services industry. Make your word problem similar to the problems we are working on this week (solving for an unknown).  Post it for us to solve, here!


You answer the question first and then respond to two of your fellow classmates with a substantive response.


DISCUSSION BOARD SIX
Pick a topic or learning outcome from Chapter(s) 1-45that helped you to gain a better understanding as to how Business Math is important to you in your activities of daily living.

Tell us how it will help you in life.



Respond to at least two of your fellow classmates. 



DISCUSSION BOARD SEVEN
You have your choice of what to discuss. Below are two options. You can also choose a subject from this area that interests you.

1.  Businesses need to charge markup in order to pay for their operations.  What is a healthy percentage of markup that should be charged for a coffin?  How might a funeral service determine the percentage markup that they should charge?



2.  What is a healthy percentage of income that should be spent on rent?  On cars?  Why?  For instance:  A person that makes $3,000 a month and has a car payment of $350 is paying $350/$3,000 = 0.1167 = 11.67%.  If that same person pays $800 a month for rent, then they are paying $800/$3,000 = 0.2667 = 26.67% of their income.



DISCUSSION BOARD EIGHT
You have your choice of what to discuss. Below are two options. You can also choose a subject from this area that interests you.

1.  The unit price of an item is how much it costs for one item.  It's useful to know the unit price when buying in bulk.  If we're buying 100 items, then you'll save quite a bit of money if you buy the unit priced item that costs $10 per item compared to the unit price of $12 per item!

You can calculate a unit price by dividing the total amount of money you spent for items by the number of items you purchased.  For instance:  $7.99 for 30 oz of goldfish is $7.99/30 = $0.26 per ounce.

Which purchase has the lower unit price - $200 for 15 flower arrangements, or $70 for 5 flower arrangements?


2.  You're considering buying a lot of a certain product.  The product costs $100 for each unit.  There are two different vendors that will sell it at that price, but they offer two different discounts:  Vendor A offers a 50% discount, while vendor B offers a 25% discount, then an additional 30% discount.

Which vendor would you use?  Why?

You answer the question first and then respond to two of your fellow classmates with a substantive response.


DISCUSSION BOARD NINE
Please make an initial post that addresses one of the following topics.  



1.  If you have employees, what will you have to plan on paying for in addition to their hourly wage?



2.  What type of payment system is better suited for funeral services - hourly wage, salary, or commission?  



Respond substantively to at least two of your fellow classmates.



DISCUSSION BOARD TEN
You have your choice of what to discuss. Below are two options. You can also choose a subject from this area that interests you.



1.  The cost of goods increases over time.  You can track the price of bread over the years and see that it goes up a little bit each year (in general).  The money you have right now can buy more than the same amount of money next year.

Lenders will loan money, but since the value of money goes down over time, they charge interest.  Why do lenders charge different percentages of interest?  For instance - here's some rates as of 6/20/2020:

Mortgage interest:  3.2% interest per year
Federal subsidized student loan: 4.2% interest per year
Small business loan: 5% interest per year
Student loan from a credit card: 10% interest per year
Store credit card interest:  20% interest per year





2. Businesses often need to take out loans to keep their day-to-day operations going.  However, too many loans means interest accrues too fast.  It's a balance!

Lenders often use a "debt to income ratio" to measure this balancing act.  You can calculate the ratio by dividing your debt by your income.  

Which is a better debt-to-income ratio?  Why?

A.  A business that has $400,000 in revenue, but $250,000 in debt
B.  A person's self-employed business takes in $85,000 a year.  The person owes $30,000 in business loans.
C.  A business owes $95,000 in loans but makes $270,000 in income each year.
